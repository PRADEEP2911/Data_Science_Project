### Motive
   We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc. to meet certain price levels.
  
   I have selected the required used car prices dataset with the needed features and parameters from Kaggle. The required data is cleaned and pre-processed using machine learning techniques before applying any algorithm for predicting the price. Then after pre-processing and cleaning the data first need to apply train_test_split to keep the data in two parts for training and validation.


## Tools and Libraries
   The tools and libraries we used are :
   
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
   - Sklearn
   - Joblib


### Dataset description
   The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
    
   - Car_Name
   - Year
   - Selling_Price
   - Present_Price
   - Kms_Driven
   - Fuel_Type
   - Seller_Type
   - Transmission
   - Owner

### Steps

   - Import the needed libraries
   - Reading and understanding the data
   - Data Preprocessing
   - Finding Outlier
   - Exploratory Data Analysis 
   - Feature Engineering
   - Train_Test_Split
   - Feature encoding
   - Feature Selection
   - Model Training
   - Prediction
